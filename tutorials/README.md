**PLEASE CLEAR ALL OUTPUTS BEFORE COMMITTING CHANGES TO NOTEBOOKS**

There are a set of tutorial notebooks here. These are compiled in the [documentation ](https://pygwb.docs.ligo.org/pygwb/)

A set of tutorials are dedicated to simulating data:

* `inject_simulated_data_in_network.ipynb` illustrates how to inject a stochastic background coherently across a network of interferometers.

* `simulator_tutorial.ipynb` shows the inner workings of the simulator object, without the need of a detector/network object.

* `simulate_CBC_GWB.ipynb` shows how to inject a CBC population of signals into a pygwb object using bilby.

A set are dedicated to understanding specific modules better:

* `test_orfs.ipynb` illustrates the overlap reduction function calculation.

* `Understand_dsc.ipynb` illustrates the delta sigma cut module.

* `make_notchlist.ipynb` describes the creation of a notch list for removing loud frequency lines.

A set of tutorials help bridge the gap between pygwb and other GW software:

*  `write_priors_for_pe.ipynb` shows how to create a prior file to use for CBC injections.
